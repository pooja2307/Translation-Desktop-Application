Project #1 – Design, Create, and Evaluate a system for helping two people that speak two different languages communicate about getting directions on campus.
 
Graduate students:
Determine requirements and Design (Estimated time: 2 hours)
1.   Interview a potential user to come up with at least two use cases (not a feature list).  From [Cockburn 2001]
a.   Use case: include actors, goals, scope, environment, satisfaction, equipment
2.   Sketch four potential designs using inVision (https://projects.invisionapp.com/) and list the features and functions supported
3.   Share your inVision project with your potential user and have them comment on your designs.  You can choose the final design, but consider your user?s input.
 
Interface (Estimated time: <8 hours)
1.   Implement a system that allows two people who primarily speak two different languages use one application to communicate about getting directions on campus.  This application must include:
1.   Use Google Translate API to do the language selection and translation (example code will be provided)
2.   Provide an ?error? button for the person receiving the translated text to click if they feel the translated text is not understandable.
3.   Have a ?complete interaction? button that, when clicked, moves the user to a page in Qualtrics where they will answer at least five survey questions.  Once the questions are answered, the user should click a ?complete survey?
 
Evaluation (Estimated time: 1 hours)
1. On the class on Wednesday, January 28th, 2015, you will pair up with another person whose primary language is not the same as yours. Your team will be given eight websites to visit and go through a scenario. We will provide the scenarios.  They will be similar to ?ask your partner for directions to a nice place to eat dinner?
?      Survey:
?      (1-10, 10 being the highest) Would you recommend our product (website) to a friend? [use this question twice, once for each person in the pair using your system, the rest of the questions can be answered as a group]
?      What did you like least about our website?
?      How easy is our website to use?
?      What features of our website are most important to you?
?      What features of our website are least important to you?
?      You can add more questions if you so choose.
2.   You will then compare the 8 scores you received for your interface scores against your partner?s scores.
